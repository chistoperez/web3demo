## Web3 Demo App

This is a simple demo app that allows users to connect their Web3 wallet to the app and displays their account and the network ID they are connected to.

## How to use

1. Clone the repository to your local machine.
2. Install the necessary dependencies by running `npm install` in the project directory.
3. Start the app by running `npm start`.
4. Open your browser and navigate to `http://localhost:3000`.
5. If you have previously connected to a wallet and your wallet is still connected, the app will automatically connect to your wallet.
6. If you have not previously connected to a wallet or your wallet is disconnected, click the "Connect Wallet" button to connect.
7. Once you are connected, the "Connect Wallet" button will be replaced with a "Disconnect Wallet" button.
